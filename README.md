# SlopeScript
SlopeScript is a programming language where code flows downhill like a skier on a mountain. Programs are structured as ski runs, with control flow mimicking the experience of navigating slopes.


The whole language is built around skiing metaphors:

Programs run from summit to lodge
Variables are "gear" you pack
Print statements carve output into the snow
Conditionals use trail ratings (greenCircle, blueSquare, blackDiamond)
Loops are gondola and liftline
Functions are tricks you can pull off
